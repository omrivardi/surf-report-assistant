# surf-repot-assistant

This is a personal side project that aims to automate surf check in Herzliya.  

The project is using dialogflow and aws lambda for fullfilments

Te project should integrate with google assistant and response for the following command:
  
## Check the surf

- Report MSW data (and next?)  

- Report bouys data and from how long ago  
  (If its more then x (12?) hours then say its not updated)

- Report live wind data and from how long ago  
  (If its more then x (4?) hours then say its not relevant)

- Report wind forecat(?)

- Ask to open cams(?)

## Check the forecat for tommorow [morning/noon/evening]

- Decide session times

- For morning and evening report first / last light

- Report MSW data (for how long?)

- Report wind forecat (for how long?)

- Open link for surf forecat / show image if possible (?)

- Additional gooogle assistant options (set alarm, set routine, hot water)

## Surf cams

- A web page that should show / link to relevant surf cams

- Think about getting different cams according to conditions (wind / wave height)
